                 ... the hyperfluid 6502 assembler!   
```
A new assembler for the Commodore C64/MOS65xx family of
8bit CPUs? ...but why?!

Good question, no real reason. In my latest hit of
nostalgia I'm revisiting my very first computer ever -
the Commodore C64. Learning its assembly language is
of course not enough, I had to write my own assembler
after trying out some others. Not because anything was
wrong with them, just for fun. Hence "hyperfluid" -
I am the first to admit this project is completely
superfluous.
